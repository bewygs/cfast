## Consolidated Fire and Smoke Transport (CFAST)

CFAST is a two-zone fire model that predicts the thermal environment caused by a fire within a compartmented structure.

Smokeview ([SMV](https://github.com/firemodels/smv)) is a visualization program used to display [FDS](https://github.com/firemodels/fds) and CFAST simulation results.
